## 02: Control Flow

Control flow mechanisms allow us to direct the flow of execution in a Python program. This week, we explore various control flow structures, including conditional statements and loops, which enable us to make decisions and repeat tasks based on specific conditions.

### Key Concepts:
- **Comparison Operators**: Comparison operators are used to compare two values.
- **if Statement**: Executes a block of code if a specified condition is true.
- **if-else Statement**: Executes one block of code if the condition is true and another block if it's false.
- **if-elif-else Statement**: Allows for multiple conditions to be checked in sequence, with corresponding code blocks executed based on the first true condition encountered.
