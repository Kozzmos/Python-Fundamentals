## 03: Loops

Loops are used to iterate over sequences or execute a block of code repeatedly until a certain condition is met.

### Key Concepts:
- **for Loop**: Iterates over a sequence (e.g., list, tuple) and executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.
- **while Loop**: Executes a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

## Loop Control Statements:

Loop control statements provide additional control over the flow of loops, allowing us to modify their behavior.

### Key Concepts:
- **break Statement**: Terminates the loop prematurely based on a certain condition.
- **continue Statement**: Skips the rest of the loop's code for the current iteration and proceeds to the next iteration.
- **nested Loops**: Allows for loops to be nested within each other, enabling more complex iteration patterns.
