# Introduction to Tuples in Python

## Understanding Tuples

### Explanation:
Tuples in Python are immutable sequences of elements. They are similar to lists but cannot be modified after creation. Tuples are defined using parentheses `()` or the `tuple()` constructor. They are commonly used for storing related data elements as a single entity.

### Topics:
1. **Tuple Creation**:
   - Creating tuples using parentheses and the `tuple()` constructor.
2. **Accessing Elements**:
   - Using indexing and slicing to access elements in tuples.
3. **Tuple Methods**:
   - Exploring tuple methods such as `count()` and `index()`.

## Advanced Tuple Operations

### Explanation:
For second part, we delve into advanced operations and techniques related to tuples. This includes nested tuples, tuple unpacking, using tuples in functions, and tuple comparison/sorting.

### Topics:
1. **Nested Tuples**:
   - Creating and manipulating tuples within tuples.
2. **Tuple Unpacking**:
   - Assigning tuple elements to individual variables.
3. **Tuples in Functions**:
   - Using tuples for data packing and unpacking in functions.
4. **Tuple Comparison and Sorting**:
   - Comparing tuples element-wise and sorting tuples.
