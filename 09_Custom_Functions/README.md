# Custom Functions in Python

## Explanation:
This class demonstrates how to create and use custom functions in Python. It includes examples of defining functions, using parameters and return values, and various use cases such as basic arithmetic, string manipulation, and user authentication.

## Topics:
1. **Defining Functions**:
   - Declaring functions using the `def` keyword.
2. **Calling Functions**:
   - Invoking functions to execute their logic.
3. **Function Parameters and Return Values**:
   - Using parameters to pass data to functions and return values to get results.
4. **Example Projects**:
   - Example projects demonstrating various custom functions.

## Code Example:
- **09_Lab**: Demonstrates various custom functions with different use cases.

## Example Projects:
- **project_1**: Categorizes and processes a list of numbers.
- **project_2**: Gets three numbers from the user and calculates their square.
- **project_3**: Counts the frequency of numbers in a list.
- **project_4**: Removes duplicate words from a string and sorts words alphabetically.
- **project_5**: A simple sign-in/sign-up system and a betting game.
